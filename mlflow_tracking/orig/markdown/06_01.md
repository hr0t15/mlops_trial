In this guide, we venture into a frequent use case of MLflow Tracking: hyperparameter tuning.

Our journey will begin with a detailed notebook that showcases hyperparameter tuning using Optuna, and how each of these tuning runs are logged seamlessly with MLflow. Following this, weâ€™ll delve deeper, exploring alternative APIs and techniques that can be leveraged to further enhance our model tracking capabilities.

Throughout this guide, our focal points will be:

* Introducing the capabilities of MLflow for tracking hyperparameter tuning
* Understanding the distinction between parent and child runs in MLflow
* Delving into the components of MLflow and their relevance in our workflow
* Discovering and navigating experiments, parent runs, and child runs in the MLflow UI
* Conducting a comparative analysis of runs to understand the nuances of hyperparameter tuning
